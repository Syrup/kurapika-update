# Introduction 👨‍💻
I made this bot the first time just for fun and i published this bot to top.gg just to try it out, then suddenly in just 3 months it reached 100+ servers and now I don't know because I haven't verified intent yet.

So, because this bot has already been used by maybe "many" servers, I will be more serious in developing this bot. Thank you ♥
